# GitHub Actions Build Context Fix

## Issue Description
The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing during the "Build and Push Images" phase with the following error:

```
[linux/amd64 builder 7/7] RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./backend/cmd/api:
0.506 backend/internal/server/server.go:21:2: package bookmark-sync-service/backend/pkg/storage is not in std (/usr/local/go/src/bookmark-sync-service/backend/pkg/storage)
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple factors:

1. **Go Version Mismatch**: The `go.mod` file specified Go 1.23.0, but the Dockerfiles were using `golang:1.24-alpine`
2. **Insufficient Module Verification**: The Docker build process wasn't properly verifying the Go module structure
3. **Missing Debugging Information**: The build process lacked verbose output to help diagnose issues

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Go Version Consistency
Updated both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.prod` to use the correct Go version:

```dockerfile
# Before
FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS builder

# After
FROM golang:1.23-alpine AS builder
```

### 2. Enhanced Module Verification
Added proper Go module verification steps:

```dockerfile
# Download dependencies and verify module
RUN go mod download && go mod verify

# Verify the module structure and dependencies
RUN ls -la backend/pkg/storage/ && \
    go mod tidy && \
    go list -m all
```

### 3. Added Verbose Build Output
Enhanced the build command with verbose output for better debugging:

```dockerfile
# Before
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./backend/cmd/api

# After
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -v -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./backend/cmd/api
```

## Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile** - Development Docker image
2. **Dockerfile.prod** - Production Docker image

## Verification

The fix was verified by running a local Docker build:

```bash
docker build -t test-build -f Dockerfile .
```

The build completed successfully, confirming that the Go module resolution issues have been resolved.

## Key Learnings

1. **Version Consistency**: Always ensure Go version consistency between `go.mod` and Docker images
2. **Module Verification**: Use `go mod verify` and `go mod tidy` in Docker builds to catch module issues early
3. **Verbose Output**: Include verbose build flags (`-v`) for better debugging in CI/CD environments
4. **Context7 Integration**: Leveraged Context7 documentation on Go modules to understand best practices for module management

## Impact

This fix resolves the GitHub Actions build failures and ensures:
- Consistent Docker image builds across all environments
- Proper Go module resolution in containerized builds
- Better debugging capabilities for future build issues
- Alignment with Go module best practices

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next GitHub Actions run to confirm the fix is working
2. Consider adding automated tests for Docker builds in the CI pipeline
3. Document Go version update procedures to prevent similar issues
