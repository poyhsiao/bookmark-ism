## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bookmark-sync-service
   ```

2. **Initial setup (recommended)**
   ```bash
   make setup
   # This will:
   # - Check prerequisites
   # - Create .env file from template
   # - Download Go dependencies
   # - Build the application
   # - Start infrastructure services
   # - Create initial database migration
   ```

3. **Manual setup (alternative)**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment configuration
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration

   # Install dependencies
   make deps

   # Start all services
   make docker-up

   # Initialize storage buckets
   make init-buckets
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
