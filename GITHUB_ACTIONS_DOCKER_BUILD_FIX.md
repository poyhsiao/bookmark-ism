# GitHub Actions Docker Build Fix

## Issue Description

The GitHub Actions CD pipeline was failing during the "Build and Push Images" phase with the following error:

```
[linux/amd64 builder 7/8] RUN ls -la backend/pkg/storage/ &&     go mod tidy &&     go list -m all:0.106 ls: backend/pkg/storage/: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.prod` files. They contained an unnecessary verification step that was trying to list the `backend/pkg/storage/` directory:

```dockerfile
# Verify the module structure and dependencies
RUN ls -la backend/pkg/storage/ && \
    go mod tidy && \
    go list -m all
```

This verification step was:
1. Unnecessary for the build process
2. Potentially fragile if the directory structure changes
3. Causing the build to fail when the directory listing failed

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Dockerfile

**Before:**
```dockerfile
# Verify the module structure and dependencies
RUN ls -la backend/pkg/storage/ && \
    go mod tidy && \
    go list -m all

# Build the application with verbose output for debugging
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -v -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./backend/cmd/api
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
# Verify and tidy dependencies
RUN go mod tidy && \
    go mod verify

# Build the application
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o main ./backend/cmd/api
```

### 2. Updated Dockerfile.prod

**Before:**
```dockerfile
# Verify the module structure and dependencies
RUN ls -la backend/pkg/storage/ && \
    go mod tidy && \
    go list -m all

# Build the application with optimizations and verbose output
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build \
    -v -a -installsuffix cgo \
    -ldflags="-w -s" \
    -o main ./backend/cmd/api
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
# Verify and tidy dependencies
RUN go mod tidy && \
    go mod verify

# Build the application with optimizations
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build \
    -a -installsuffix cgo \
    -ldflags="-w -s" \
    -o main ./backend/cmd/api
```

## Changes Made

1. **Removed unnecessary directory listing**: The `ls -la backend/pkg/storage/` command was removed as it was not essential for the build process.

2. **Simplified dependency verification**: Replaced the complex verification with standard Go module commands:
   - `go mod tidy` - ensures go.mod and go.sum are consistent
   - `go mod verify` - verifies dependencies haven't been tampered with

3. **Removed verbose build output**: Removed the `-v` flag from the build command to reduce log noise.

4. **Kept essential functionality**: All essential build steps remain intact.

## Benefits

1. **More robust builds**: The build process no longer depends on specific directory structures that might change.

2. **Cleaner logs**: Reduced verbose output makes it easier to identify actual issues.

3. **Standard Go practices**: Uses standard Go module verification commands instead of custom directory checks.

4. **Faster builds**: Slightly faster build times due to reduced operations.

## Testing

The fix should be tested by:

1. Running the GitHub Actions CD pipeline
2. Verifying that Docker images build successfully
3. Confirming that the built images work correctly
