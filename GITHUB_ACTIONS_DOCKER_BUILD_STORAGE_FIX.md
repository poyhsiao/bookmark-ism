# GitHub Actions Docker Build Fix - Storage Package Issue

## Problem
The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline was failing during the "Build and Push Images" phase with the following error:

```
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c echo \"=== Build Environment Debug ===\" && ... go build ... ./backend/cmd/api" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified as a missing Go package. The `backend/cmd/api/main.go` file was importing:
```go
"bookmark-sync-service/backend/pkg/storage"
```

However, the `backend/pkg/storage` package did not exist in the repository, causing the Go build to fail during the Docker image build process.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Missing Storage Package
Created `backend/pkg/storage/client.go` with the following features:
- MinIO client wrapper for object storage operations
- Integration with the existing config system
- Support for file upload, download, delete operations
- Health check functionality
- Bucket management
- Presigned URL generation

### 2. Updated Package Structure
- Used the existing `config.StorageConfig` type instead of creating a duplicate
- Properly imported the config package
- Ensured type compatibility across the application

### 3. Added Unit Tests
Created `backend/pkg/storage/client_test.go` with:
- Basic client creation tests
- Integration test structure (skipped in unit test mode)
- Proper test coverage for the new package

### 4. Simplified Docker Build Process
Updated both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.prod` to:
- Remove unnecessary debug output that was cluttering the build logs
- Streamline the build process
- Maintain proper multi-stage build structure
- Keep security best practices (static linking, minimal final image)

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `backend/pkg/storage/client.go` - Main storage client implementation
- `backend/pkg/storage/client_test.go` - Unit tests for storage client

### Files Updated:
- `Dockerfile` - Simplified build process, removed debug output
- `Dockerfile.prod` - Simplified production build process
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Maintained existing Docker build test
- `.github/workflows/cd.yml` - Maintained existing build and push process

## Technical Details

### Storage Client Features:
```go
type Client struct {
    client     *minio.Client
    bucketName string
}

// Key methods:
- NewClient(config.StorageConfig) (*Client, error)
- EnsureBucketExists(context.Context) error
- UploadFile(context.Context, string, []byte, string) (string, error)
- DownloadFile(context.Context, string) ([]byte, error)
- DeleteFile(context.Context, string) error
- HealthCheck(context.Context) error
- ListFiles(context.Context, string) ([]string, error)
- GetFileURL(context.Context, string) (string, error)
```

### Configuration Integration:
The storage client uses the existing `config.StorageConfig` structure:
```go
type StorageConfig struct {
    Endpoint        string `mapstructure:"endpoint"`
    AccessKeyID     string `mapstructure:"access_key_id"`
    SecretAccessKey string `mapstructure:"secret_access_key"`
    BucketName      string `mapstructure:"bucket_name"`
    UseSSL          bool   `mapstructure:"use_ssl"`
}
```

## Verification
- Local Go build test: ✅ `go build -o test-build ./backend/cmd/api`
- Package imports resolved: ✅ All missing dependencies created
- Docker build structure: ✅ Multi-stage build maintained
- Configuration compatibility: ✅ Uses existing config system

## Expected Results
After this fix, the GitHub Actions pipeline should:
1. Successfully build the Docker image during CI tests
2. Successfully build and push images during CD deployment
3. Have proper storage functionality available in the application
4. Maintain all existing security and performance optimizations

## Dependencies
The storage package uses the existing dependency:
- `github.com/minio/minio-go/v7 v7.0.66` (already in go.mod)

No additional dependencies were required, maintaining the existing dependency footprint.
