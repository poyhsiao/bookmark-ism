### 2. **Semantic Search with NLP**
- Intent-based query enhancement (learning, reference, news)
- Context-aware search boosting with semantic scoring
- Natural language query processing and understanding
- Advanced ranking algorithms with semantic relevance

### 3. **Intelligent Auto-Complete**
- Multi-source suggestions (titles, tags, domains)
- Frequency-based ranking and deduplication
- Type-specific suggestions with usage counts
- Real-time suggestion generation with configurable limits

### 4. **Search Result Clustering**
- Domain-based and tag-based clustering algorithms
- Semantic cluster naming and scoring
- Automatic result categorization with confidence metrics
- Configurable clustering parameters and thresholds

### 5. **Saved Searches & History**
- Persistent saved searches with PostgreSQL storage
- Search history with Redis-based caching
- Automatic cleanup and expiration management
- Complete CRUD operations with user isolation
