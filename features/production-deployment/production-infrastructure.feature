# Task 26: Production Deployment Infrastructure
# BDD Feature for Production Docker Compose Configuration with Scaling Options

Feature: Production Deployment Infrastructure
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want to deploy the bookmark sync service in production
  So that users can access a scalable and reliable service

  Background:
    Given the bookmark sync service is fully developed and tested
    And all previous tasks (1-25) are completed successfully
    And I have access to production environment resources

  Scenario: Create production Docker Compose configuration
    Given I need to deploy the service in production
    When I create a production Docker Compose configuration
    Then it should include optimized settings for all services
    And it should support horizontal scaling for Go backend services
    And it should include resource limits and health checks
    And it should use production-grade security settings

  Scenario: Implement container orchestration with Docker Swarm
    Given I have a production Docker Compose configuration
    When I set up Docker Swarm orchestration
    Then it should support multi-node deployment
    And it should provide automatic failover capabilities
    And it should enable service scaling across nodes
    And it should maintain service availability during updates

  Scenario: Create automated deployment pipeline
    Given I have Docker Swarm orchestration configured
    When I create an automated deployment pipeline
    Then it should support CI/CD integration
    And it should include automated testing before deployment
    And it should support rolling updates with zero downtime
    And it should provide rollback capabilities

  Scenario: Configure production environment settings
    Given I have an automated deployment pipeline
    When I configure production environment settings
    Then it should use secure secrets management
    And it should include proper logging and monitoring
    And it should optimize for performance and reliability
    And it should support multiple environments (staging, production)

  Scenario: Enable horizontal scaling for backend services
    Given I have production environment configured
    When I enable horizontal scaling for Go backend services
    Then it should support scaling API services independently
    And it should maintain load balancing across instances
    And it should preserve session state and data consistency
    And it should automatically adjust to load demands

  Scenario: Validate production deployment
    Given I have horizontal scaling configured
    When I validate the production deployment
    Then all services should start successfully
    And health checks should pass for all components
    And the system should handle expected load
    And monitoring should report system status correctly
