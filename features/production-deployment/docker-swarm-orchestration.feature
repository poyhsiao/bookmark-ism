# Docker Swarm Orchestration Feature
# BDD Feature for Docker Swarm Mode Implementation

Feature: Docker Swarm Orchestration
  As a system administrator
  I want to orchestrate containers using Docker Swarm
  So that I can achieve high availability and scalability

  Background:
    Given Docker is installed on all target nodes
    And the nodes can communicate with each other
    And the bookmark sync service images are available

  Scenario: Initialize Docker Swarm cluster
    Given I have multiple Docker nodes available
    When I initialize a Docker Swarm cluster
    Then the manager node should be created successfully
    And worker nodes should be able to join the cluster
    And the cluster should be ready for service deployment

  Scenario: Deploy services to Docker Swarm
    Given I have a Docker Swarm cluster initialized
    When I deploy the bookmark sync services to the swarm
    Then all services should be distributed across available nodes
    And services should be accessible through the swarm routing mesh
    And load balancing should work correctly across replicas

  Scenario: Scale services in Docker Swarm
    Given I have services deployed to Docker Swarm
    When I scale the API service to multiple replicas
    Then the new replicas should be distributed across nodes
    And the load balancer should include new replicas
    And the system should handle increased traffic

  Scenario: Handle node failures in Docker Swarm
    Given I have services running on multiple nodes
    When a worker node becomes unavailable
    Then services should be rescheduled to healthy nodes
    And the system should maintain service availability
    And no data should be lost during the failover

  Scenario: Perform rolling updates in Docker Swarm
    Given I have services running in the swarm
    When I perform a rolling update of the API service
    Then the update should proceed without downtime
    And old replicas should be replaced gradually
    And the service should remain available throughout the update

  Scenario: Monitor swarm cluster health
    Given I have a Docker Swarm cluster running
    When I check the cluster health status
    Then all nodes should report as healthy
    And all services should show desired replica counts
    And resource utilization should be within acceptable limits
