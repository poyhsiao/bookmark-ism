# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a self-hosted multi-user bookmark synchronization service that provides cross-browser bookmark management with a visual interface similar to Toby. The system will consist of a backend API service for bookmark storage, synchronization, sharing, and user management, along with browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that provide bookmark sync functionality, social features, and a Toby-like visual bookmark management interface.
