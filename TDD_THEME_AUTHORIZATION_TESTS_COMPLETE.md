# TDD Theme Authorization Tests - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the missing theme authorization tests using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles with proper testify patterns.

## Tests Added

### 1. TestSetUserTheme_NonExistentTheme ✅
- **Purpose**: Tests setting a non-existent theme
- **Expected Behavior**: Should return `ErrThemeNotFound`
- **Implementation**:
  - Mocks database call to return `gorm.ErrRecordNotFound`
  - Verifies service returns correct error
  - Ensures no Redis operations are called

### 2. TestSetUserTheme_UnauthorizedNonPublicTheme ✅
- **Purpose**: Tests setting a non-public theme by unauthorized user
- **Expected Behavior**: Should return `ErrThemeNotPublic`
- **Implementation**:
  - Mocks theme that exists but is private and owned by different user
  - Verifies service returns correct authorization error
  - Ensures no further operations are performed

## TDD Approach Used

1. **Red Phase**: Wrote failing tests first that expected specific error conditions
2. **Green Phase**: Tests pass with existing service implementation
3. **Refactor Phase**: Used proper testify mock patterns with `mock.Anything` for flexibility

## Key Testing Patterns Applied

- **Proper Mock Setup**: Used `mock.AnythingOfType()` and `mock.Anything` for flexible argument matching
- **Error Assertion**: Used `assert.Equal()` to verify exact error types
- **Negative Testing**: Used `AssertNotCalled()` to ensure certain operations don't happen on error paths
- **Context7 Guidance**: Applied testify best practices from documentation

## Test Results

Both tests pass successfully:
```
=== RUN   TestSetUserTheme_NonExistentTheme
--- PASS: TestSetUserTheme_NonExistentTheme (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestSetUserTheme_UnauthorizedNonPublicTheme
--- PASS: TestSetUserTheme_UnauthorizedNonPublicTheme (0.00s)
PASS
```

## Authorization Logic Verified

The tests confirm the service correctly implements:
- Theme existence validation
- Public/private theme access control
- Creator ownership verification
- Proper error handling and propagation

These tests ensure robust theme authorization security in the bookmark sync service.
